Then "sudo gedit 50-unbuntu.conf"
After that in the file that pops up add the line "allow-guest=false"
Then add "greeter-show-manual-login=true" *makes it so you have to type in the users whole login not just password
Then do "sudo service lightdm restart
$ 
Disable unauthorized services and get backdoors
"cd /etc/sudoers.d/" "ls" and check for anything shady should only be a readme
"sudo visudo" check to make sure authorized groups are allowed, or leave it as default
Then "sudo crontab" this checks anything that can be run at like startup, delete anything thats malicious or comment it out (#)
Backdoor checking
"cd /bin/"
"ls"
If there was any malicious files in "crontab" do "./(file directory)" then it should run  if its executable
then do "sudo rm (file or file dir)" then delete it

More crontabs
"cd /etc/"
"sudo su"*gain root privelages*
"cd /var/spool/cron/crontabs/

$
Disable the Super User or "su"
"cd /etc/pam.d/"
"ls"
"sudo nano su"
look for line that contains 'SU_WHEEL_ONLY'
then the line underneath should be "#auth	required	pan_wheel.so"
un comment that line to disable su, su is disabled unless your in the "Wheel" group
an alternative is do "sudo gedit /etc/login.defs" then uncomment "SU_WHEEL_ONLY"
$
Check wheel group
"sudo gedit /etc/group"
sometimes it isnt there but if it is only users in that line can use "su" so anyone that isnt supposed to be there, remove them
$
Check more startups 
"cd /etc/"
"sudo gedit rc.local"
This should have text that claims it does nothing which is good but then if theres anything else delete that text not the whole file
$

"cd /etc/"
"cd init.d/"
"ls"
$
if needed take off samba
"sudo apt-get purge samba"

"cd /var/log/"
"ls"
shows little things but the one below shows specifics
"sudo gedit auth.log"

"netstat -tulpn"
or "lsof -i -n -P
or "ss -l"

Lock command history file
"sudo chmod 640 .bash_history"
